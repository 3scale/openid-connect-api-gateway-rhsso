These configuration files implement Authorization Code OAuth flow using Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) as an authorization server.
The calls are authenticated through `client_id` and `client_secret` generated by 3scale, and `access_tokens` are generated by RH-SSO, after the user is authenticated against RH-SSO via a login form.
